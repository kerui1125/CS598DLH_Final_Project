# Reproducing and Validating Fair Conformal Predictors for Applications in Medical Imaging

This repository is the implementation of CS598DLH_Final_Project: Reproducing and Validating Fair Conformal Predictors for Applications in Medical Imaging

## Requirements

To install requirements:

```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Training

To train the model(s) in the paper, run this command (The parameters are baked in at train.py):

```train
python src/train.py
```
See the training result in the root directory with name similar to run_2023_month_day_hour_minute

## Evaluation

validation and testings are included in train process as well


## Results

Conformal prediction methods were applid in the notebook repro.ipynb. The diagrams are also included.
